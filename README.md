Apple Quality Analysis Project

This repository contains the code and datasets used for analyzing the quality of apples based on various physical and chemical characteristics. The analysis aims to explore relationships between different attributes such as size, weight, sweetness, crunchiness, juiciness, ripeness, and acidity, and how they correlate with the perceived quality of apples.
Getting Started
Prerequisites

To run the scripts, you will need Python installed on your machine, along with the following Python libraries:

    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:

bash

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine to get started with the analysis:

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/apple-quality-analysis.git
cd apple-quality-analysis

Usage

The main script can be run from the command line. It will load the data, perform preprocessing steps, visualize the data distributions, and apply several machine learning models to predict apple quality and analyze the relationships between different variables.

bash

python apple_analysis.py

Project Structure

    apple_quality.csv: The dataset containing attributes of apples and their quality ratings.
    apple_analysis.py: Python script for conducting the analysis.

Analysis Steps

    Data Loading: Load the apple quality data.
    Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis, including handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generate histograms and box plots to understand the distributions and detect outliers.
    Correlation Analysis: Use heatmaps to identify the relationships between the variables.
    Machine Learning: Apply logistic regression and linear regression to predict apple quality and other attributes. Evaluate the models based on their accuracy.
    Clustering: Perform K-means clustering to identify patterns in apple characteristics.

Results

    The results from the EDA provide insights into the typical characteristics of high-quality and low-quality apples.
    Regression analysis helps to understand which features are most predictive of quality and other attributes.
    Clustering identifies distinct groups of apples with similar characteristics.
